Things that need doing ASAP:

Testing -- full automated testing for

document abstraction in github for release canvas 2

user testing for canvas 2

LONG TERM PRODUCT VISION FOR CANVAS 2

CURRENT NUMBER ONE BUG:
2020-01-13 08:10:52.201 5061-6385/com.example.wildfire_fixed_imports D/OkHttp: <-- HTTP FAILED: java.io.IOException: unexpected end of stream on https://wildfirewatch.herokuapp.com/...
2020-01-13 08:10:52.209 5061-5061/com.example.wildfire_fixed_imports E/AndroidRuntime: FATAL EXCEPTION: main
    Process: com.example.wildfire_fixed_imports, PID: 5061

    no idea what's causing this but likely can be solved with better error handling within our retrofit implementation

system for handling/replacing/editing fires when they change.

NEED ERROR HANDLING FOR HTTP AND PROBABLY OTHER AREAS
-->>mostly done, SuccessFail wrapper and network_controllers infrastrcture supports both handling at the controller level as well as passing errors, throwables
and exceptions up the chain.

FIX BUG THAT CAUSES ICONS TO LOSE COLOR
 -->> likely due to icons being deprecated, https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-plugins-android/tree/master/plugin-annotation
   --> switch to symbols from icons, shouldn't be tremendously hard and symbols appear to offer other options.

LOW PRIORITY:

/api/users/ RETURNING LIST INSTEAD OF SINGLE OBJECT
   //AS OF 1/142020 incorrectly returns a list of webBEUsers instead of the single altered object,
    //when web fixes the implementation, should be easy enough to simple drop List<> and result[0\
    @PUT("/api/users/")
    suspend fun updateUser(@Header("Authorization") token: String, @Body user: SafeWebUser): List<WebBEUser>
